## Main Component
In the root(`Eplant/main.tsx`), you can see the `Eplant` component, whchi is our main component of our application.  

`main.tsx`
```
<React.StrictMode>
  <Provider>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Config.Provider value={defaultConfig}>
        <Eplant />
      </Config.Provider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

We only have one single Route at the moment but we will have one Route for one component.  


`Eplant.tsx`
```
<ThemeProvider theme={darkMode ? dark : light}>
  <CssBaseline />
  <Routes>
    <Route path={rootPath}>
      <Route index element={<MainEplant />} />
    </Route>
  </Routes>
</ThemeProvider>
```

Eplant app consists of `Sidebar` and `EplantLayout` as shown in `Eplant.tsx` (`Eplant/Eplant.tsx`)
```
export function MainEplant() {
  return (
    <>
      <Sidebar />
      <EplantLayout />
    </>
  )
}
```


## Eplant Layout
Eplant Layout (`Eplant/EplantLayout.tsx`) hosts the actual views and ViewContainer (`Eplant/UI/Layout/ViewContainer/index.tsx`) is main component that does this. 

`view` will be passed as a prop to the ViewContainer which will be rendered in 
```
<view.component
    state={state}
    geneticElement={gene}
    activeData={activeData}
    dispatch={dispatch}
/>
```


### useViewData
The `useViewDatai` function is a custom React hook designed to manage and load view data in the application. It leverages TypeScript generics to handle different types of view data, state, and actions.

See `Eplant/View/viewData.ts` for more details.



## View Interface
Please see the `View` interface in `View \index.ts`
This is the interface we use for most of the `views`

The View interface is a TypeScript interface that defines the structure and functionality expected from a view component in a React application.


### getInitialState:

An optional method that returns the initial state of the view. If not defined, the state defaults to null.
This method initializes the state when the view is first rendered.


### getInitialData:

A required method that fetches the data needed for the view based on a given gene and provides loading feedback.

### reducer:

An optional reducer function used to handle actions and update the state. This is useful for managing state changes based on different actions.


### actions:

An optional array of actions that can be shown in the viewâ€™s options menu. Each action allows interaction with the view.


### component:

A required React component that renders the view.
Takes props of type ViewProps<Data, State, Action>.


### icon:

An optional React component that returns an icon representing the view. This is used in the gene info viewer to visually identify the view.

### name:

A required string that represents the name of the view. This is used to identify the view in various contexts.

### id:

A required string that provides a unique identifier for the view.


### description:

An optional string that provides a description of the view.

### thumbnail:

An optional string that represents the URL or path to a thumbnail image for the view.

### citation:

An optional React component that renders citations related to the gene. This helps in displaying references or additional information.
Takes props which may include state, activeData, and gene.

### header:

An optional function that returns the title of the view's tab.
Takes props of type `ViewProps<Data, State, Action>`.


## state
`state` (`Eplant/state/index.tsx`) is a React module that manages state using `Jotai` and provides various hooks and utility functions for managing application state in the application, which is similar to `Redux` and `React Hooks`.

### Atoms: 
Basic units of state. An atom holds a piece of state that can be read from and written to.
### Hooks: 
useAtom is used to interact with atoms, allowing components to access and update state.
### Simplicity:
Minimal boilerplate and API surface, making it easy to understand and use.
### Reactivity: 
Components automatically re-render when atom state changes.

## When you create a new `view`
If you are going to a build new View, `GetStartedView` (`Eplant/views/GetStartedView/index.tsx`) is the right one to look at.

First, create `index.tsx` by defining and exporting a View configuration object that uses the `GetStartedView` component.

### Define GetStartedView Object:

**name**: Set a descriptive name for the view ("Get started").  
**component**: Assign the GetStartedView component.  
**getInitialData**: Define a method to fetch initial data (returns null in this case).  
**id**: Assign a unique identifier ("get-started").  
**icon**: Specify an icon (HomeOutlinedIcon) for the view.  


Next, create the `GetStartedView` component that serves as an introductory view, guiding users on how to interact with the application.

### Define GetStartedView Component:

**Theme**: Use useTheme hook to access the theme for styling.  
**Render Component**:  
Display introductory text about the application.
Provide instructions using Material-UI's Stack and Typography components.
Create a Grid layout to display multiple Tile components for each view, filtered by the presence of description and thumbnail.


If you need an additional component, follow `Tile.tsx`. This is used in `component.tsx`.

Create a UI component ( `Tile.tsx`) that displays a view's information and allows users to activate a specific gene and view when interacting with it.

### Define Tile Component:

**Props**: Accept a view object which includes information about the view.  
**State and Hooks**:
Use useGeneticElements, useSetActiveGeneId, and useSetActiveViewId hooks to manage genetic elements and active view/gene states.  
**`setView` Function**:
Fetch a specific gene (AT3G24650) using the arabidopsis.api.searchGene method.
Set this gene as the active gene and update the active view.  
**Render Component**:  
Use Material-UI's Card component to structure the tile, including CardMedia, CardContent, and CardActions.
Display the view's thumbnail, name, and description.
Add a button to activate the view and gene when clicked.


### Summary
1. Create `index.tsx`: An object that configures the view with the GetStartedView component and relevant metadata.
2. Create `component.tsx`: A component that provides a guide for getting started and displays a grid of Tile components.
3. Create `Tile.tsx`: A component for displaying individual view tiles with an interactive button to set active genes and views.
