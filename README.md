# ePlant
ePlant is a gene-first visualization tool for plant genomes.

## Using ePlant
Create a new tab or choose a gene of interest (GOI) using the search bar on the left. 
> Currently the only plant genome available is that of _arabidopsis thaliania_. 

Use the navigation dropdown to discover more information about the expression of that gene from a phenotypic to a molecular level.

### Gene information
Contains a list of gene information:
- Which views are available for this gene
- The gene name and aliases
- Brief and computational descriptions
- Curator summary
- Location and gene model
- DNA sequence
- Protein sequence

### Publication
A list of relevant publications.
- Author, year, journal, title, and links to publications associated with the GOI
- Gene RIFs with annotations and links source to paper

### Plant
A visual map of where the gene is expressed in the body of the plant.
  - Choose a data mode (relative/absolute)
  - Select diagram: AtGenExpress or Klepikova
  - Sort diagrams by name or expression level
  - Hover over images for more information

### Tissue & Experiment
Expression patterns in different cells.
 
<!-- 
### Heat map
Based on experiments done by the lab, the striated bars show [when?where?] a given gene is expressed.
Yellow: weak, red: strong

### World (KM scale)
Gene extression infomration plotted on a map.
You can overlay climate information (precipitation, historical max temp, historical min temp).


### Chromosome (micro-meter, sub-micrometer)
Localization of the gene on the chromosomes. Can see local genes as well

### Interaction level
 Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions for a given gene and geen product.

### Molecule (nano meter) 
Protein sequence

### Sequence viewer
JBrowser instance from Araport

### Navigation
See the relations of the gene to other plant genes. -->

## Roadmap

## How to contribute
Read the [onboarding blueprint](https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant/issues/29).

If you'd like to contribute, [pick an issue](https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant/issues). We use a forking workflow. For an in-depth look at what that means, [read this article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

### Quickstart
1. Create a fork and download it to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your fork address>
    ```
1. Set up the main ePlant project as your upstream branch.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant
    ```
1. Verify your node version. Most folks are working with v18.18.0.
    ```bash
      node -v
    ```
    If that command doesn't return anything, [install the LTS version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

1. Download all dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
1. Run your local version of ePlant.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
1. Comment on a ticket to take it.
1. Turn on notifications for that thread.
1. Complete the necessary fix.
1. Push your changes to **your** fork.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
1. Create a pull request. 
    > Underneath where it says **Compare changes**, there is a line that says 
      > `Compare changes across branches, commits, tags, and more below. If you need to, you can also compare across forks.`
    Click that link to bring up a dropdown menu of ePlant forks. 
1. Choose your fork as the head repository and `https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant/` as the base repository.
1. Give the pull request a descriptive title so that someone who didn't work on it will know what you did. Link the issue if possible.
