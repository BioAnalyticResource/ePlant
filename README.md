# ePlant
ePlant is a gene-first visualization tool for plant genomes.

## Using ePlant
Create a new tab or choose a gene of interest (GOI) using the search bar on the left. 
> Currently the only plant genome available is that of _arabidopsis thaliania_. 

Use the navigation dropdown to discover more information about the expression of that gene from a phenotypic to a molecular level.

### Gene information
Contains a list of gene information:
- Which views are available for this gene
- The gene name and aliases
- Brief and computational descriptions
- Curator summary
- Location and gene model
- DNA sequence
- Protein sequence

### Publication
A list of relevant publications.
- Author, year, journal, title, and links to publications associated with the GOI
- Gene RIFs with annotations and links source to paper

### Plant
A visual map of where the gene is expressed in the body of the plant.
  - Choose a data mode (relative/absolute)
  - Select diagram: AtGenExpress or Klepikova
  - Sort diagrams by name or expression level
  - Hover over images for more information

### Tissue & Experiment
Expression patterns in different cells.
 
<!-- 
### Heat map
Based on experiments done by the lab, the striated bars show [when?where?] a given gene is expressed.
Yellow: weak, red: strong

### World (KM scale)
Gene extression infomration plotted on a map.
You can overlay climate information (precipitation, historical max temp, historical min temp).


### Chromosome (micro-meter, sub-micrometer)
Localization of the gene on the chromosomes. Can see local genes as well

### Interaction level
 Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions for a given gene and geen product.

### Molecule (nano meter) 
Protein sequence

### Sequence viewer
JBrowser instance from Araport

### Navigation
See the relations of the gene to other plant genes. -->

## Roadmap

## How to contribute
Read the [onboarding blueprint](https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant/issues/29).

If you'd like to contribute, [pick an issue](https://github.com/BioAnalyticResource/ePlant/issues). We use a forking workflow. For an in-depth look at what that means and an example, [read this article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).
